                <p>One century after the death of the original Black Viper, in the late 15th century DR, she returned to Waterdeep to continue her criminal activities. Rumors passed between the noble houses of Waterdeep discussing how and why she'd returned, but none were true. In reality, the Black Viper's title and persona were adopted by Esvele Rosznar, a brash young noble woman of Waterdeep who wanted a way to escape her day-to-day life.</p>
